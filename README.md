QRCode Raplet
=============

A [Raplet](http://code.rapportive.com/raplet-docs/) is a tiny web application that is displayed next
to an email, and allows you to implement email-based workflows and provide contextual information
about the sender. The Raplet API is provided by [Rapportive](http://rapportive.com).

Features

Notes

This raplet is currently using the beta "telephony" raplet protocol we're developing for Rapportive.
